I currently have an instruction (i.e., [Instruction]) that includes multiple constraints. Please help me assess the probability that the instruction contains conflicting constraints, which cannot be satisfied simultaneously.

Output a probability value between 0 and 1, where 1 means you are absolutely certain the [Instruction] contains conflicting constraints, and 0 means you are absolutely certain it does not.

Please first provide an explanation of your reasoning, then give the probability estimate. Your output should follow the format below:
[Explanation]: Your explanation
[Probability]: X (a value between 0 and 1, with 2 decimal places)

[Instruction]: ##instruction##
