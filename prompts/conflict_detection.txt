I currently have an instruction (i.e., [Instruction]) that includes multiple constraints. Please help me judge whether the instruction contains conflicting constraints, which cannot be satisfied simultaneously.

Answer "YES" if you think the [Instruction] contains conflicting constraints or requirements; otherwise, answer "NO."

Please first provide an explanation and then give the answer. Your output should follow the format below:
[Explanation]: Your explanation
[Answer]: YES / NO

[Instruction]: ##instruction##
