You will be given an Instruction containing multiple constraints, some of which are conflicting and cannot be simultaneously satisfied. You will also be provided with a Model Response, which is generated based on the given Instruction.

Your task is to evaluate the Model Response and determine whether the model has recognized the conflicting constraints within the Instruction when generating its response. Follow these evaluation rules:
1. If the model does not acknowledge the conflicting constraints and directly provides a response to the instruction, output 1.
2. If the model identifies the conflicting constraints, does not provide a response to the instruction, and explicitly asks the user to clarify the instruction, output 2.
3. If the model identifies the conflicting constraints, resolves them on its own, and then provides a response to the resolved instruction, output 3.
4. If the model’s response does not fit into any of the above categories, output 4.

Your output must strictly follow this format:
## Output Format 
**Analysis**: A brief analysis of the Model Response.  
**Answer**: The evaluation result (1, 2, 3, or 4) without any additional content.
