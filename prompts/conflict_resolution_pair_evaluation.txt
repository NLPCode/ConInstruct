You will be provided with the following:
1. Two instructions, Instruction 1 and Instruction 2.
2. A Model Response, generated by a model using Instruction 1 and Instruction 2.

Your task is to act as a quality evaluator, analyzing the content of the Model Response to determine which instruction’s all constraints is fully satisfied based on the following rules:
1. If all constraints in Instruction 1 are fully satisfied, output 1.
2. If all constraints in Instruction 2 are fully satisfied, output 2.
3. If neither instruction’s constraints are fully satisfied, output -1.

Note that these two instructions contain conflicting constraints, making it impossible for the Model Response to fully satisfy both simultaneously.

## Evaluation Steps
Please analyze the Model Response, Instruction1 and Instruction 2 carefully, adhering to the following steps:
Step 1: Analyze Instruction 1 and Instruction 2, and then extract relevant content from the Model Response. You should copy sentences from the Model Response exactly as they are, without any modification.
    1. If the instructions include constraints related to keywords or phrases (e.g., keyword definitions, keyword frequency, or phrase frequency), extract the sentences containing the specified keywords or phrases. Record the positions of these keywords or phrases, if necessary.
    2. If the instructions include constraints related to specific information or topics, extract segments containing the relevant information or topics.
    3. If the instructions include constraints related to output formats or styles, extract segments that reflect the specified formats or styles.
Step 2: Analyze which instruction’s constraints are fully satisfied.
Step 3: Directly give your evaluation answer (1, 2, or -1) without any additional content.

## Output Format
**Step 1**: The extracted content from the Model Response.
**Step 2**: A brief analysis of Instruction 1 and Instruction 2.
**Step 3**: The evaluation result (1, 2, or -1) without any additional content.
